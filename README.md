# Wordle Project

Welcome to the Wordle BDD project, a comprehensive demonstration of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies in action. This project leverages the power of Serenity BDD, Cucumber, and JUnit 5 to build, specify, and document a microservice-style application.

## Aim

The goal of the Wordle project is to serve as an illustrative example of how modern software development principles, such as BDD and TDD, are used in conjunction with API-driven acceptance tests. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner venturing into the world of microservices, this project has valuable insights to offer.

## Tech Stack

- **Serenity BDD:** An open-source library that helps you write higher-quality automated acceptance criteria.
- **Cucumber:** A tool that supports BDD, enabling you to define application behavior in plain meaningful English language.
- **JUnit 5:** The next generation testing framework for Java and JVM.

## How to Run the Tests

To execute the tests, you will need to run the following command:

```bash
mvn verify
```

## How to run the application

You can run the application locally as follows:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Once running, you can access the application at http://localhost:9000/api/status and see the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:9000/swagger-ui.html

## Reports

Upon completion of the tests, Serenity reports are generated in the `target/site/serenity` directory. You can view a sample report [here](https://serenity-dojo.github.io/wordle/).
